# Story Workspace: The 46-Loop Forge

This file tracks the iterative data mining and summary process for reconstructuring the 46-loop evolution of the AI Training Strategy.

## Phase 1: Seeds in the Mist (Loops 1-32)

_Status: Completed Mining_
**Key Findings**:

- **Ambiguity**: Early versions focused on "Enlightenment" and "AI Awareness" without hard requirements.
- **Structural Normalization**: Loops 1-4 focused on fixing the basic numbering and aligning the goal (Enlightenment) with the acceptance (Course review).
- **The "Idealism" Trap**: Loops 12-27 (per history) likely drifted into technical specifics that were too prescriptive, which were later pruned in Loop 28-32.

## Phase 2: Thunder of Logic (Loops 33-34)

_Status: Completed Mining_
**Key Findings**:

- **The RAG Pivot**: Loop 33 tried to use RAG for risk detection.
- **The Fatal Flaw**: "Semantic-Asset Gap". AI cannot catch hidden risks via vague business intent.
- **The Birth of Determinism**: Adjudicator forced the shift from "Probabilistic AI" to "Deterministic Domain Mapping". Safety moved from the model to the architecture.

## Phase 3: The Concrete Gap (Loops 34-35)

_Status: Completed Mining_
**Key Findings**:

- **Black Box Realism**: Strategic concepts were "hollow" without definitions.
- **Appendix A is Born**: Loop 34 mandated the creation of the **"AI Application Risk Mapping Table"**.
- **Transformation**: The document transitioned from a "Strategy" to a "Technical Specification".

## Phase 4: The Battle of Contracts (Loops 36-41)

_Status: Completed Mining_
**Key Findings**:

- **Subjectivity vs. Evidence**: Loop 37 identified that "Committee Approval" is a subjective risk.
- **Hardening**: Introduced **"Negative Test Cases"**, **"Staging Mirrors"**, and **"Bid-Linked Commitments"**.
- **Sovereignty**: Ensured the Bank has an "Objective Fuse" (Appendix B) to disqualify low-quality bids before signing.

## Phase 5: The Return to Talent & Final Bridge (Loops 42-46)

_Status: Completed Mining_
**Key Findings**:

- **The Instructional Pivot**: Realized that for a "Training" project, the success metric must be **"Student Capability"**, not just "Tool Performance".
- **The Responsibility Bridge**: Loop 46 solved the "Liability Vacuum" by adding the **"Bridge of Real User Stress Testing"** and **"Defect Attribution (RCA)"**.
- **Final Result**: A 92/100 score, reaching the "Industrial Sweet Spot" where technical rigor is enforced through instructional success.
